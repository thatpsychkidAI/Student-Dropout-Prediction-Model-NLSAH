# Project Title: Dropout Prediction using National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Dataset

# Description:
The purpose of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict which students are most at risk of dropping out of school using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). This is an important area of research as identifying students at risk of dropping out early can help education officials develop targeted interventions and prevent students from leaving school before completing their education.

# Dataset:
The Add Health dataset is a nationally representative survey that began in 1994 and has followed a cohort of adolescents into adulthood. The data is publicly available on the Add Health website (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/data).

# Process:
1.Data Preparation: The first step in this project was to load and preprocess the dataset using Python and the pandas library. This involved selecting relevant variables, filtering out missing values, and recoding variables as needed.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Next, we explored the data to understand the distribution of variables, correlations between variables, and any patterns or trends in the data. We used Python and the seaborn and matplotlib libraries to create visualizations that helped us gain insights into the data.
3. Feature Selection: Based on the exploratory data analysis, we selected a subset of features that we believed would be most predictive of dropout risk. This involved using domain knowledge and statistical tests to identify the most important variables.
4. Machine Learning Modeling: We trained and tested several machine learning models on the selected features to predict dropout risk. We used Python and scikit-learn, a machine learning library, to build and evaluate the models. We selected the best performing model based on its accuracy and other performance metrics.
5. Model Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of the selected model on a held-out test set and used various evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's performance.
6. Interpretation and Visualization: Finally, we interpreted the results of the model and visualized the most important features and their impact on dropout risk.

# Conclusion:
We found that our machine learning model was able to accurately predict which students were most at risk of dropping out of school using a subset of features from the Add Health dataset. Our results suggest that certain demographic, behavioral, and academic factors are strong predictors of dropout risk. These findings can help educators and policymakers develop targeted interventions to prevent students from dropping out of school early.

# Documentation:
I documented the entire project, including the code, analysis, and results, in a clear and organized manner, including comments and annotations to explain the thought process and reasoning behind each step. This documentation is then published on a public repository on Github for others to view and use.
